Course Project in DATS-SHU 240 Intro to Optimization and Mathematical Programming. This is a group project completed by Alex Zou and me, mentored by Professor Zhibin Chen.

* Presented a mathematical model that builds upon the SEIR model to simulate the COVID outbreak in Shanghai 2022, with economics, public mental health, and severe cases taken into consideration
* Optimized Shanghai 2022 lockdown policy with Genetic Algorithm and populated the results with real pandemic data
* Conducted a sensitivity analysis of economic, public mental health and severe cases loss to understand the optimization results
